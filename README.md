# Introduction #
The aim of this Unity project is to implement a technique for realtime reverb audio simulation proposed in the research paper
["Real-time Room Reverb in Large Scenes using Transport Path Precomputation"](https://jcgt.org/published/0009/01/03/) by Gregor MÃ¼ckl and Carsten Dachsbacher.
